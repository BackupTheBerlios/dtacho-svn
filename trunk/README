dtacho project
==============


INFO
----

This project aims to develop an operating system independent open source
software to convert driver card and vehicle unit byte data of a digital
tachograph (DTCO) to XML. An application to examine and visualize the data
shall also be developed.

Web page (German):        http://www.digitaler-tachograph.org/
Project/development page: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dtacho/

User and developer mailing lists for this project are available. For details
see our web page or the project page at Berlios.

For information/specifications of the DTCO see below, chapter SPECIFICATIONS.


LICENSE
-------

dtacho is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.




FORMAT CONVERTER
================

STATUS
------

The format converter from byte data to XML is written in Java. The status of
dtacho is alpha. It may not work under all circumstances and may produce false
or unexpected results.

24.02.2008
This software converts both the data of DTCO driver card .DDD files (C_*.DDD)
and the data of vehicle unit .DDD files to XML files.

The code for converting driver card .DDD files was developed by Martin Barth
in his diploma thesis.and was extended by Gerald Schnabel to also convert the
data of vehicle unit files.


NOTES
-----

This software depends on some additional components (jars) that can be found
in the classes directory.

These jars were obtained from the following sources:

* xmlrpc

  URL: http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
  File: xmlrpc-3.1-bin.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -xmlrpc-common-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-client-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-server-3.1.jar
  -commons-logging-1.1.jar
  -ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar

* jdom

  URL: http://www.jdom.org/
  File: jdom-1.1.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -jdom-1.1.jar


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
----------------------

There are two possibilities to get a running version of the program.

1. Download a code-snapshot

Code-Snapshots (JAR archives) are available at http://dtacho.berlios.de/jar/

To run the program you will need a recent Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6.

The syntax from command line is
java -jar dtacho-yyyymmdd.jar <drivercardfile.DDD>

For environment variables see chapter ENVIRONMENT.

To have the data integrity of driver card files checked you need the
European Public Key EC_PK.bin in the current directory or you have to set
the environment variable EURPKPATH to the path where the key can be found.

See section THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC KEY.


Examples:

 gerald@dtachodev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -jar dtacho-20080122.jar \
 C_driver_card.DDD

 This will read the driver card file C_driver_card.DDD, print some (debug)
 info and output the file C_driver_card.DDD.xml


 Multiple files/wildcards are supported via command line, e.g.

 gerald@dtachodev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -jar dtacho-20080122.jar \
 C_*.DDD

 will convert all driver card files (C_*.DDD) in the current directory
 to XML files.


2. Build from latest source from SVN repository

-Getting the source

 The source can be checked out from Berlios.de via SVN.

 gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dtacho/trunk


-Compiling the source

 To compile the source the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed.
 Please use a recent JDK. Development is done with version 6.0u5.
 See http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp for more.

 -change to the trunk/src directory

  gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test$ cd trunk/src

 -run the java compiler:

  gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test/trunk/src$ javac -cp ".:../classes/*" org/digitalertachograph/DDDQuery/*.java


-Running the program

 For environment variables see chapter ENVIRONMENT.

 If you have compiled the source as described above you are already in the
 correct directory.

 If you have compiled the source in eclipse change to the bin directory.

 'ls -lR | grep ^d' should give the following output:

 gerald@dtachodev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ ls -lR | grep ^d
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 org
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 digitalertachograph
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DDDQuery
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 internalData
 drwxr-xr-x 2 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DataTypes

 To run the format converter it is required to include
 -the current directory
 -the directory that contains the additional jar files mentioned in chapter
  NOTES
 to the java class path.

 This is done with the option -cp.

 To have the data integrity of driver card files checked you need the
 European Public Key EC_PK.bin in the current directory or you have to set
 the environment variable EURPKPATH to the path where the key can be found.

 See section THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC KEY.


 Examples:

 gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -cp ".:../classes/*" \
 org.digitalertachograph.DDDQuery.Controller C_driver_card.DDD

 This will read the driver card file C_driver_card.DDD, print some (debug)
 info and output the file C_driver_card.DDD.xml


 Multiple files/wildcards are supported via command line, e.g.

 gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -cp ".:../classes/*" \
 org.digitalertachograph.DDDQuery.Controller C_*.DDD

 will convert all driver card files (C_*.DDD) in the current directory
 to XML files.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

-DEBUGLOGLEVEL:
 The level for debug messages.
 Standard is ERROR.
 The following levels, from the lowset to the highest, are possible:
 NOTHING >> ERROR >> INFO >> INFO_EXTENDED >> ALL

 NOTHING: no debug messages
 ERROR: only output messages when there was an error
 INFO: output info messages
 INFO_EXTENDED: output extended info messages
 ALL: output all messages

 A selected level includes all levels below!

-DEBUGPRINTSTREAM:
 Stream, where the debug messages are put.
 Standard is the standard output (System.out, stdout).
 Otherwise the debug messages are appended to the file given by this environment
 variable. Appending can be disabled by specifying DEBUGPRINTSTREAMAPPEND=false.

-EURPKPATH:
 Path to the European Public Key, see chapter THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC KEY.


THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC KEY
-----------------------

The European Public Key can be found on the web site of the European
Root Certification Authority (ERCA) at http://dtc.jrc.it/text/erca.html

The file EC_PK.bin from the archive EC_PK.zip is required for the byte
data to XML converter.

The converter looks for the file EC_PK.bin in the path set by the environment
variable EURPKPATH (or the current path, if EURPKPATH is not set).
