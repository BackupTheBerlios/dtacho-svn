dtacho project
==============


INFO
----

This project aims to develop an operating system independent open source
software to convert driver card and vehicle unit byte data of a digital
tachograph (DTCO) to XML. An application to examine and visualize the data
shall also be developed.

Web page (German):        http://www.digitaler-tachograph.org/
Project/development page: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dtacho/

User and developer mailing lists for this projects are available. For details
go to our web page or the project page at Berlios.

For information/specifications of the DTCO see below, chapter SPECIFICATIONS.


STATUS
------

The byte data to XML converter is written Java.

08.12.2007
Currently this software converts a DTCO driver card .DDD file to an XML file.
The code was developed by Martin Barth in his diploma thesis.


NOTES
-----

This software depends on some additional components (jars) that can be found
in the classes directory.

The jars were obtained from the following sources:

* xmlrpc

  URL: http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
  File: xmlrpc-3.1-bin.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -xmlrpc-common-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-client-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-server-3.1.jar
  -commons-logging-1.1.jar
  -ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar

* jdom

  URL: http://www.jdom.org/
  File: jdom-1.1.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -jdom-1.1.jar


HOW TO RUN
----------

Change to the top of the directory tree where you find the org directory.
E.g. if you have compiled the source in eclipse change to the bin directory:

gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ ls -lR | grep ^d
drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 org
drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 digitalertachograph
drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DDDQuery
drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 internalData
drwxr-xr-x 2 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DataTypes

To run the format converter it is required to include
-the current directory
-the directory that contains the additional jar files mentioned above
to the java class path.

This is done with option -cp.

Example:

gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -cp ".:../classes/*" \
org.digitalertachograph.DDDQuery.Controller driver_card.DDD

This will read the file driver_card.DDD, print some (debug) info and output
the file driver_card.xml
