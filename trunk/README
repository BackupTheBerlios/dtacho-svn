dtacho project
==============


INFO
----

This project aims to develop an operating system independent open source
software to convert driver card and vehicle unit byte data of a digital
tachograph (DTCO) to XML. An application to examine and visualize the data
shall also be developed.

Web page (German):        http://www.digitaler-tachograph.org/
Project/development page: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dtacho/

User and developer mailing lists for this project are available. For details
see our web page or the project page at Berlios.

For information/specifications of the DTCO see below, chapter SPECIFICATIONS.


LICENSE
-------

dtacho is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.


STATUS
------

The byte data to XML converter is written in Java. The status of dtacho is
alpha. It may not work under all circumstances and may produce false or
unexpected results.

16.12.2007
Currently this software converts the data of a DTCO driver card .DDD file
(C_*.DDD) to a XML file. The code was developed by Martin Barth in his diploma
thesis. Development is continued by Gerald Schnabel.


NOTES
-----

This software depends on some additional components (jars) that can be found
in the classes directory.

The jars were obtained from the following sources:

* xmlrpc

  URL: http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
  File: xmlrpc-3.1-bin.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -xmlrpc-common-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-client-3.1.jar
  -xmlrpc-server-3.1.jar
  -commons-logging-1.1.jar
  -ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar

* jdom

  URL: http://www.jdom.org/
  File: jdom-1.1.tar.gz
  JARS:
  -jdom-1.1.jar


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
----------------------

-Getting the source

 The source can be checked out from Berlios.de via SVN.

 gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dtacho/trunk


-Compiling the source

 To compile the source the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed.
 See http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp for more.

 -change to the trunk/src directory

  gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test$ cd trunk/src

 -run the java compiler:

  gerald@dtachodev:/tmp/dtacho_test/trunk/src$ javac -cp ".:../classes/*" org/digitalertachograph/DDDQuery/*.java


-Running the program

 If you have compiled the source as described above you are already in the
 correct directory.

 If you have compiled the source in eclipse change to the bin directory.

 'ls -lR | grep ^d' should give the following output:

 gerald@dtachodev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ ls -lR | grep ^d
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 org
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 digitalertachograph
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DDDQuery
 drwxr-xr-x 3 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 internalData
 drwxr-xr-x 2 gerald gerald 4096 2007-12-02 20:49 DataTypes

 To run the format converter it is required to include
 -the current directory
 -the directory that contains the additional jar files mentioned in chapter
  NOTES
 to the java class path.

 This is done with the option -cp.


 Examples:

 gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -cp ".:../classes/*" \
 org.digitalertachograph.DDDQuery.Controller C_driver_card.DDD

 This will read the driver card file C_driver_card.DDD, print some (debug)
 info and output the file C_driver_card.DDD.xml


 Multiple files/wildcards are supported via command line, e.g.

 gerald@dtachdev:~/workspace/dtacho/bin$ java -cp ".:../classes/*" \
 org.digitalertachograph.DDDQuery.Controller C_*.DDD

 will convert all driver card files (C_*.DDD) in the current directory
 to XML files.


 NOTE: currently only driver card files (C_*.DDD) are supported! See
       chapter STATUS.
